## problem
* while high variance necessitates using more samples, bias is more pernicious
  * even with an unlimited number of samples, bias can cause the algorithm to fail to converge,
    or to converge to a poor solution that is not even a local optimum

## observation
* key to variance reduction is to obtain good estimates of the advantage function

## idea: GAE:  generalized advantage estimator
* use a **trust region optimization** method for the value function
* GAE has two parameters $\gamma$ and $\lambda$ which adjust the bias-variance tradeoff.
  * allows us to smoothly interpolate between the high-bias estimator (λ = 0) and the low-bias estimator (λ = 1).

## setup
* combine this idea with trust region policy optimization and a trust region algorithm that optimizes a value function, 
  * both represented by neural networks.

## result
* the bias is prohibitively large when using a one-step estimate of the returns
* future:
  * the relationship between value function estimation error and policy gradient estimation error.
  * shared function approximation architecture for the policy and the value function, 
  
## background
* credit assignment problem:
  * the long time delay between actions and their positive or negative effect on rewards
* the variance of the gradient estimator scales unfavorably with the time horizon, 
  * since the effect of an action is confounded with the effects of past and future actions.

## comment
* on accurate estimate of critic (advantage fn) and using Trust Region to optimize the value function
